## Introduction

This project is a Java-based implementation of the popular Tic Tac Toe game. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players take turns to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') until one player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their symbols, or the game ends in a draw if the grid is filled.

The game is built using Object-Oriented Programming principles to maintain clean and modular code.

## Features

- Text-based console interface.
- Two-player mode for playing against a friend.
- Interactive gameplay with input validation.
- Detection of wins and draws.
- Simple and intuitive user experience.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java source files using the command:
javac Main.java

4. Run the compiled program using the command:
java Main

5. The game will display an empty 3x3 grid and prompt the players to take turns entering their moves.
6. To make a move, enter the row and column numbers (both starting from 0) when prompted.
7. The game will continue until a player wins or the grid is filled, resulting in a draw.

## Usage

- The program uses the standard Java libraries, so no additional dependencies are required.
- Compile and run the program as explained in the "How to Play" section.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to make moves and play the game.
- After the game ends, you can play again by running the program again.
